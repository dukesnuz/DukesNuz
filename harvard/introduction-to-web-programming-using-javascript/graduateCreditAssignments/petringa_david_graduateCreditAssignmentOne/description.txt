/************************************HED Graduate Credit Assignemnt One Fall 2016
 *
 * This application created, coded and tested by David Petringa
 * I hope you enjoy this app.
 *
 * Thank you for viewing my Graduate assignment one for the class Introduction to Web Programming Using JavaScript at HES.
 * The main objective is to demonstrate my knowledge of functions, arrays and working with numbers all within JavaScript.
 * I tried to explain as much as possible regarding how this works. 
 * I also tried to make the code as easily readable as possible. I am using aptana for my IDE.
 * Apatna has a tidy/format feature which re-aligns code for human reading.
 * It tends to wrap my for loops into 2 lines when I have 2 var variables. I think I may change the way I decalre the variables
 * to stop the wrap in for loops
 *
 * This is a  mortage calculator. The Javascript function will verify that numbers greater than zero are enetered in each
 * field. The results will be stored in a multi-dimensonal array. The display button is set to disabled until at least one element
 * is in the results array. The display button will display all the results for the current session. I created  a function to create an HTML
 * table. If more than five calculations are made the visitor is notified by an annoying pop up to insert $.025 to continue. 
 * The calculations should be accurate.
 *
 * More HTML and CSS could have been used to pretty up the page. 
 * I chose to concentrate on the functionality of the JavaScript.
 * I hope you enjoy this.
