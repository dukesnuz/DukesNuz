JaZahn,

Greetings

Project: CSCI E - 3 -Introduction to Web Programming Using JavaScript  - Final Project - Fall 2016

My project started off small and grew. 
I am using an api to retrieve JSON data. The data returns a list of cities for each state selected along with latitude, longitude and 
other data for each city.

I am using the latitude and longitude to draw a map for the selected city. I am using mapquest api to retrieve the desired map
which is then printed in the canvas element using css backgroundImage property. After going over week 14, I thought of a cool 
way to include the canvas api into my application. The selected city and state along with rotating lines are added using the canvas api.  
I found the mapquest api to be very user friendly. To me it seems easier easier to implement than google maps. Mapquest documentation seems 
easier to understand.

I am not particularly happy with the way my formValidation functions turned out. I was trying to use closures and create a reusable
form validation function. FOr form2, favorite color form, I originally had only an input form for the the color. At the last minute 
I decided to change it to a drop down list and also added a style property to the javascript to change the body color.

I am thinking of turning the application into a game at some point in the future. Storing the high scores and favorite 
locations in local storage. 
 
I have included the files for my project in my submission. I am using a php script to call the server hosting the JSON data.
So you should load the files into a local server or the files can be viewed live as I uploaded all the files to my site. 
On the right side of this project's home page there are links to all the files used and submitted. (See menu option)
 
Here is a link to the live site.
